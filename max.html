                    <p><i>In a world where super heroes are ancient history… Only one remains. Incarcerated for her
                            crimes, Maxine Jopp knows how to be patient. She probably isn’t the most powerful of all the
                            fallen meta-humans. But she’s probably the smartest of them. People think they can control
                            her, and sure they can. As long as she’ll let them do so. But one day, she’ll have her
                            revenge. And they’ll never see it coming.</i></p>

                    <p>Story still on-going, available for free on <a class="articlelink"

                    <hr class="separator" style="width: 20%">

                    <p>Stuck in the backseat of the black SUV, Delsin still hadn’t quite understood what the fuck he was
                        doing here. The last mission had been hard on him and he had hoped for a little vacation but
                        obviously his chief, Leno, had other plans in mind for him. Through the window of the moving
                        car, he briefly saw the sign indicating the Pittsfield Massachusetts Women minimum security
                        prison. He sighed loudly, which draw the attention of Leno sitting next to him.</p>

                    <p>“What?” she asked. She was always patient with her agents; mostly with Delsin. She always had a
                        certain tenderness towards the young man that she couldn’t explain. He frowned, confused and
                        tired.</p>

                    <p>“I had to get up super early for that. So, why do we have to talk to this…” he opened the file
                        laying on his lap, he couldn’t remember that girl’s name, “Maxine… Jopp. What even is that
                        name?”</p>

                    <p>“It’s German. And, yes we have to talk to her.”</p>

                    <p>“That wasn’t my question, boss. Why? Does she know something about that new case of yours?”</p>

                    <p>"No."</p>

                    <p>Then you lost me there."</p>

                    <p>"You'll see."</p>

                    <p>Delsin closed the file and threw it on the free seat between them. Leno picked it up and put the
                        sheets back in it, she liked when things were organised. The young man scoffed discreetly and
                        turned his head again towards the window, watching the signs pass. He had been working for the
                        Section 20 for a long time already, even if he couldn’t remember exactly when he began. But
                        Leno’s silence and secrets about some parts of the job were still annoying to him. He didn’t
                        understand why he absolutely had to be there. On his day off, nonetheless… But Leno insisted.
                        Well, she was the boss so it was more like she gave an order. He would have loved to question
                        Trevor about this “Maxine whatever” because he seemed to know her when her name was mentioned at
                        the reunion this morning, but he didn’t had the time. Leno was in a hurry, as always. After a
                        three hours drive, the gate was finally in sight. Delsin sighed like a fed up kid and get out of
                        the car as soon as the driver stopped in front of the main door. Leno took her time, which made
                        Delsin even more sick and tired about all of this. When she arrived next to him, she simply
                        said.</p>

                    <p>“Maxine is a bit special. And I brought you here for one good reason. You’ll understand soon
                        enough.”</p>

                    <p>Delsin didn’t even wanted to respond to that, it felt like an obvious taunt. Leno guided him to
                        the front desk. She showed her badge, explained the situation. A prison guard led them to the
                        visitation room. From there, Delsin could see a hallway behind a reinforced glass window. The
                        prison was minimum security so the women weren’t confined in their cell all day long. He heard a
                        bored voice announcing “<i>Jopp, you have visitors. Hurry, please</i>” through a microphone.
                        Leno was sitting completely upright and still in her chair, hands crossed on the table. She was
                        serene, patient. Which wasn’t Delsin’s case at all. He had his eyes fixed on the door, creepily
                        watching every single women coming in, but none of them seated in front of them. But finally,
                        the door opened again. A young woman came in. Her face was the incarnation of boredom. Her hands
                        were deep inside the pockets of the ugly grey sweater she was wearing. She turned on herself,
                        looking at the tables around her. The moment she laid eyes on Leno, her expression changed. A
                        smirk appeared on her face, and her eyes lit up. She approached nonchalantly. Delsin noticed she
                        was thin, her short hair was black as a crow and her eyes… A beautiful deep green. She ignored
                        him and looked at Leno directly.</p>

                    <p>“Hey, Leno… Long time no see…”</p>

                    <p>She spoke with a light but charming German accent. Delsin had a glimpse of a tattoo on her wirst
                        but he didn’t seen what it was.</p>

                    <p>“True”, Leno said in a neutral tone.</p>

                    <p>Something happened. Maxine started to fix her intensely. She closed her eyes a few seconds, as if
                        she was in a deep thought. Then she opened them again, obviously happy about something.</p>

                    <p>“So, how’s the new boyfriend? Vincent, is that right? Twenty-nine years old. Born in Seattle…
                        Came to New-York to study but stayed because his family was shit. He works in a museum I think…
                        Wait, Museum Curator, am I right? Quite charming, I’d even say sexy. Big future in sight. Try to
                        keep this one for more than three month.”</p>

                    <p>Leno smiled, Maxine’s little trick was always hilarious even if she was used to it. “Sure Jopp,
                        your relation advice are always welcome.”</p>

                    <p>“Figured. So, what do you want this time?”</p>

                    <p>“The Doll Maker.”</p>

                    <p>Maxine started to laugh loudly. She seemed amused but also quite satisfied for some reason. A
                        shiver went down her spine. Oh, all the things she could ask with that one…</p>

                    <p>“Leno, Leno, Leno… You’re always so funny. I hope you have arguments of steel for me to get on
                        that one. That psycho is worse than the Mississippi’s killer.”</p>

                    <p>“Let’s keep it short, shall we. What do you want?”</p>

                    <p>Maxine took a long and deep breath. Like she one she’ll take when she’s out of there. Her smirk
                        didn’t disappear. Quite the opposite, it became a big grin, making Delsin feel uneasy.</p>

                    <p>“I want my freedom. Complete, freedom. None of that on parole bullshit. I want you to stop
                        watching me. I want you to pay for my mom’s treatment. And I want my dad to be executed.”</p>

                    <p>Leno scoffed, amused, “Sure, Jopp. And what about an all-week vacation to Hawaii?”</p>

                    <p>“Depends, can I have a hot masseuse to go with that? Are they still wearing that thing…”</p>

                    <p>She was about to mime two coconuts shell on her breast when Leno suddenly bursted in rage. She
                        hit the table so hard that everybody around stopped talking and Delsin almost fell from his
                        chair. Maxine didn’t move one bit and put her hands back in her pockets with an even bigger
                        smile on her face. That was definitely what she wanted to accomplish. She won that round, way
                        too easily. Leno knew that, she bit her tongue so hard she almost bled. The felon was still
                        staring at her with her daring green eyes. The conversations around them continued and Leno
                        sighed. Happy about her victory, Maxine was ready to make a concession.</p>

                    <p>“Ok I can take back my dad’s execution if you want.”</p>

                    <p>“I have another proposition.”</p>

                    <p>Maxine shrugged and scoffed, everything about this negotiation seemed funny to her.</p>

                    <p>“Well you can try, I’m listening.”</p>

                    <p>“Complete freedom… Under full surveillance during the investigation then partial afterwards if
                        you agree to see a therapist.”</p>

                    <p>Maxine reflected on that, trying to fully understand the rules of the game and what cards she
                        could try to play.</p>

                    <p>“Hm… Freedom under surveillance during the investigation. Then without any if I agree to see your
                        therapist.”</p>

                    <p>“A complete freedom without surveillance is unthinkable. At least try to be reasonable.”</p>

                    <p>Maxine took her time to think again, weighing the pros and cons.</p>

                    <p>“Freedom under surveillance during the investigation, then partial surveillance with that
                        therapist of yours like you said. But! But… I want my mom’s treatment to be taken care of.”</p>

                    <p>"Deal."</p>

                    <p>Said Leno right away before the young woman changed her mind as she did a lot of times before.
                        Leno then turned to Delsin and finally introduced him.</p>

                    <p>“Let me present you Delsin Rowe. He will be your supervisor.”</p>

                    <p>Delsin looked at Leno, he would have liked to be aware of that fact before getting there but oh
                        well, it was too late now. He turned to Maxine who was looking at him. More like creepily
                        staring at him. She looked at him for a long time, she looked puzzled, confused, almost scared.
                        Her grin had left her face to go on Leno’s.</p>

                    <p>“No. Hmhm. No. No way. He’s a ghost.”</p>

                    <p>“No. Hmhm. No. No way. He’s a ghost.”</p>

                    <p>“I know.”</p>

                    <p>Delsin was kind of lost right now. He looked at both women, without knowing what the fuck was
                        happening.</p>

                    <p>“I don’t understand, chief.”
                    <p>

                    <p>“As I told you, Maxine here is special. She’s a meta-human. And she will do as I say, aren’t you,
                        Maxine? Delsin will be your supervisor and that’s the end of it. You’ll be able to go back to
                        your house in Manhattan. Delsin will be there, he will sleep in your guest room. We will come to
                        pick you up tomorrow morning. Have a good day.”</p>

                    <p>Leno got up before Maxine had the chance to say anything. Delsin was once again completely
                        confused about the whole thing. He obediently followed her to the car while Maxine just sat
                        there, looking confused and lost. Once in the car, Delsin decided he had enough of that strange
                        day.</p>

                    <p>“Ok, this is annoying. Now tell me. I though all meta-humans had been executed. Or at least were
                        in a special facility.”</p>

                    <p>“Yes. And you know why?”</p>

                    <p>“Because we couldn’t find a way to remove their powers, I know that. But what is she doing here,
                        alive, in a minimum security prison?”</p>

                    <p>“Let me introduce Maxine.”</p>

                    <p>Leno took back the file and opened it on a page Delsin hadn’t read yet because let’s face it, he
                        could be lazy. He started to read quietly while Leno developed what he had under his eyes.</p>

                    <p>“She was born in Berlin in 2019. She had an arduous childhood and teenage-hood. She started to
                        have powers a bit before her twentieth birthday and she worked with a group named the Heroic
                        League. They escaped from us quite a few times thanks to her. When we finally caught her, she
                        was deemed too precious to be executed, and easily manageable.”</p>

                    <p>“So… You kept her in a normal prison? In a minimum security prison if I may add.”</p>

                    <p>He was still puzzled about all of that. The Heroic League were the most dangerous meta-humans
                        criminals the Section 20 faced. The Section was even created just to watch them; then hunt them
                        down.</p>

                    <p>“Did you see the names on her wrist?”</p>

                    <p>“That tattoo? No, I didn’t had time.”</p>

                    <p>“They are her protectors, her friends. People who could have helped her on the outside. But she
                        doesn’t have anyone anymore. She’s helpless. We offer her privileges from time to time to keep
                        her calm and obedient.”</p>

                    <p>Delsin was still kind of confused about her utility in the investigation.</p>

                    <p>“Why do you need her? I don’t get it.”</p>

                    <p>“Maxine can connect herself to any network or electrical device without the need of an interface.
                        Just with her mind. She uses that and her wide knowledge in computers to track any information
                        about anyone. We tried to put her in a Faraday’s cage but it didn’t prevent her of using her
                        power.”</p>

                    <p>He nodded slowly, he was starting to understand a bit better.</p>

                    <p>“So, that’s how she knew about your boyfriend?”</p>

                    <p>“Exactly. And that’s why you are the best for this job.”</p>

                    <p>“Because I… Don’t officially exist. I see.”</p>

                    <p>“And that’s also why she refused.”</p>

                    <p>“She doesn’t trust people, I guess?"</p>

                    <p>“Yes.”</p>

                    <p>Delsin felt like he learned a lot, but still not that much. Like if Leno was holding back
                        information, as this file was, because he didn’t learn a lot more while reading it.</p>

                    <p>“I feel like you’re not telling me everything.”</p>

                    <p>“Of course I’m not. We need Maxine much more than she needs us. But she can’t know that and we
                        need her trust more than anything, because she works much better that way. So we need you to
                        gain her trust and bond with her in a normal way instead of just stuffing you with details and
                        facts. If you know too much about her, she’ll freak out.”</p>

                    <p>“I see… I’ll try.”</p>

                    <p>“Good. Don’t let her get information on you without a counterpart. As we say, knowledge is power
                        and this is even more true for her. She’s very dangerous, remember that.”</p>

                    <p>“Fuck me. All of that sounds so complicated. Anything else? Other powers maybe?”</p>

                    <p>“Yes, about that. Yes, she has. She can see the memories attached to someone, something or
                        somewhere. If she touches someone, something or enters somewhere and there are … Strong memories
                        attached to any of that…”</p>

                    <p>The young men felt a bit confused about that.</p>

                    <p>“So if she touches me, she’ll know everything about me? That plan is stupid you know.”</p>

                    <p>“I’m not finished. When she uses that power, she has flashes. Violent, disturbing flashes. She
                        hates that power and she’ll never touch you, don’t worry.”</p>

                    <p>He still felt like Leno’s plan sucked but anyway, she was the boss.</p>

                    <p>“Ok, if you say so… Anything else?”</p>

                    <p>“Yes. She can kill you without even touching you. But don’t worry, we have leverage on her.” </p>

                    <p>Delsin’s heart almost stopped. What did she mean by that? What the fuck? How could she say
                        something like that and then refuse to answer any of his questions for the three hours drive to
                        come back home? This day was more and more confusing. And those to come seemed way more
                        dangerous than everything he faced until now.</p>
