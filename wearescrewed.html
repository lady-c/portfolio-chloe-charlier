            <p>Developed by <a class="text_link" href="https://www.rarebyte.com/">Rarebyte</a>.</p>
            <p>My roles: Narrative Designer, UI/UX Designer, Localization Agent.</p>

            <p>I had the privilege of writing all the content for the game, originally in English, and also handled the
                complete French localization. My responsibilities included crafting small and humorous bios for each
                character (both playable and NPCs), quests for each Multiverse from a diverse cast of NPCs, and names
                and descriptions for each weapon (Module) and their variants, as well as worlds, ships, maps, enemies,
                bosses, items, and tools. The tone throughout is fun and light, incorporating absurd humor with
                wordplay, space puns, and a healthy dose of pop culture references.</p>

            <hr class="long_separator">

            <p>Part of my responsibilities included redesigning the entire UI.</p>
            <p><i>The challenge I faced was that the existing UI was considered a bit boring, with its main color being
                    dark grey, and it didn’t look very polished.</i></p>

            <p class="caption">Dialogue Box UI: Old and new.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_dialoguebox.JPG">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_dialoguebox.jpg">
            <p>The box now resizes vertically to fit the text, the colors are brighter and prettier, and the portrait is
                in a higher definition.</p>

            <p class="caption">Tutorial page UI: Old and new.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_tutorial.JPG">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_tutorial.jpg">
            <p>As before, the colors were reworked to make the whole UI prettier and friendlier. One of the UX changes I
                made to this specific element was ensuring that the buttons to accept and, consequently, remove the
                tutorial page appear only on the last page. This was an attempt to encourage players to read the
                tutorials more, but as any UI/UX designer knows, making players read tutorials is never an easy task. In
                the end, what I learned was that if people don’t want to read, nothing will make them. Ultimately, my
                goal was to create a playable tutorial instead, because doing is better than reading (I was very
                inspired by Moving Out), but unfortunately, I never had the time to design a proper one.</p>

            <p class="caption">Inspection window UI: Old, concept and in game.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_inspection.JPG">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_inspection2.png">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_inspection.jpg">
            <p>This UI was particularly important, as it is the one players see the most. It can be triggered on
                anything they interact with to provide information, such as modules, items, weapons, tools, and parts of
                the ship. It was sometimes hard to see, so I made the UI brighter and used colors to code all the
                elements so players could quickly identify the type of object they were inspecting. I also used colors
                to highlight important information and moved the interaction instructions out to make them more visible
                as well.</p>

            <p class="caption">Map selection, ship selection, waiting for players: Old UI and flow.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_map_selection2.JPG">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_ship_selection.JPG">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_waiting.JPG">

            <p class="caption">Map selection, ship selection, waiting for players: New UI and flow.</p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_map_selection.jpg">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_ship_selection.jpg">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_waiting.jpg">

            <p>This was a very interesting UI to rework. It is a screen displayed within a 3D object inside the main
                scene. Players use the console inside the Station, so this small screen needs to display very clear
                information. The colors were reworked, as well as the complete layout of each screen. The map selection,
                which used to be just a scrollable list, was changed to a full map where players can navigate from one
                teleporter to another. The ship selection now shows the ship in a larger view to showcase our ships up
                close, with the stats taking up half of the screen to make them more visible.
                <br>The final screen displays and reminds players which map and ship were chosen. It also shows the
                portraits of the player characters along with the prompt "Stand on a button!" The portraits become
                colored and tilt slightly to the side in the "activated state."
                <br>This choice was made to address a problem we observed with players. After picking a map and a ship,
                buttons would pop out of the ground on which players had to stand to continue. However, either they
                wouldn’t see them right away, or one of them wasn’t standing properly on their button without realizing
                it. With the prompt, they know they have to stand on the buttons, and with the portraits, they can see
                who is standing on their button correctly, as they go into the "activated state" when they do.</p>
