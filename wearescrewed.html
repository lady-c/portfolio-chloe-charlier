            <p><i>The multiverse is in danger! Alone or in a team of up to 4 people, slide into the pilot’s seat,
                    operate a turret, become a mechanic or even a janitor. There is a lot to do and no time to lose!

            <p>Developed by <a class="text_link" href="https://www.rarebyte.com/">Rarebyte</a>.</p>
            <p>My roles: Narrative Designer, UI/UX Designer, Localization Agent.</p>

            <p>I have written everything in the game. The original language was English, and I also did the complete
                French localization. My responsabilities included writting a small and funny bio for each characters
                (playables, and NPCs),
                quests for each Multivers from a diversified cast of NPCs, names and description for each weapon
                (Module) and their variants, worlds, ships, maps, enemies, bosses, items, tools... The tone is fun and
                light,
                and the humour is absurd with some word plays and space puns and a healthy dose of pop culture
                references.</p>
            <p><i>Writing samples in preparation.</i></p>

            <hr class="long_separator">

            <p>Part of my responsabilities included the redesign of the entire UI.</p>
            <p><b>The problem I had to find a solution for was that the UI was deemed a bit boring, the main color being
                    dark grey, and that it didn't look very polished.</b></p>

            <p><b>Old Dialogue Box vs. the new version.</b></p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_dialoguebox.JPG">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_dialoguebox.jpg">
            <p>The box now resizes vertically to fit the text, the colors are brighter and prettier and the portrait is
                in a higher definition.</p>

            <p><b>Old tutorial page vs. the new version.</b></p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_tutorial.JPG">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_tutorial.jpg">
            <p>As before, the colors got reworked to make the whole UI prettier and friendlier. One of the UX changes I
                made on this specific element is that the buttons to accept and consequently, remove the tutorial page,
                appear only on the last page. This was made in an attempt to make players read the tutorials more, but
                as any UI/UX designer know, making players read tutorials is never an easy task. In the end, what this
                taught me was that if people don't want to read, nothing will make them. Ultimately, my goal was to
                create a playable tutorial instead, because doing is better than reading (I was very inspired by Moving
                Out), but unfortunately never got the time to design a proper one.</p>

            <p><b>Inspection window, old, concept, and in game.</b></p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_inspection.JPG">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_inspection2.png">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_inspection.jpg">
            <p>This UI was particulary important, as this is the one players see the most. This can be triggered on
                anything they can interract with to give them infos. It means modules, items, weapons, tools, parts of
                the ship. It was hard to see sometimes, so I made the UI brighter, and used colors to code all the
                elements so they could know what type of object they were inspecting quickly. I also used colors to
                highlight the important information, and moved the interaction instructions out to make them more
                visible as well.</p>

            <p><b>Map selection, ship selection, waiting for players. Old UI and flow.</b></p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_map_selection2.JPG">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_ship_selection.JPG">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_original_waiting.JPG">

            <p><b>Map selection, ship selection, waiting for players. New UI and flow.</b></p>
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_map_selection.jpg">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_ship_selection.jpg">
            <img class="screenshot" src="./img/WAS/was_new_waiting.jpg">

            <p>This was a very interesting UI to rework. This is a screen displayed within a 3D object inside the main
                scene. Players are using the console inside the Station, so this is a small screen that needs to display
                very clear information.
                <br>Colors got reworked, but also the complete layout of each screens. The map selection used to be
                just a scrollable list and was changed to a full map where players can naviagate from one teleporter to
                another.
                <br>The ship selection shows the ship in big, which was made to show off our ships up close and the
                stats are more visible since they take half of the screen.
                <br>The last screen is displayed and reminds which map and which ship were chosen. It also displays the
                portraits of the player characters as well as the prompt "Stand on a button!". The portraits get colored
                and tilt a bit to the side in "activated state".
                <br>This was a choice made to answer a problem that we noticed when observing players. After
                picking a map and a ship, buttons were popping out of the ground on which players had to stand to
                continue, but either they wouldn't see them right away, or one of them wasn't standing properly on
                theirs, without knowing it. With the prompt, they know they have to stand on the buttons and with the
                portraits, they know who is standing on their button properly since they go in "activated state" when
                they do.</p>
