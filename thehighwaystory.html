            <p><i>It's a hot Sunday morning, the sun has risen just about an hour ago. Your mom woke you up early
                    because today is one of your uncle's birthday, you know, one of those relatives that you see
                    probably once or twice a year at the most. You don't really know much about him, and you don't care
                    much for him either. But he's family and your mom insisted for you to come with her. You know it's
                    going to be a long drive and you're tired from last night's gaming session. It was "Just... one...
                    more... turn..." all over again. But you needed that to take your mind off of your issues. You
                    failed math class and you will have to attend summer school to be able to get into the next year,
                    and you didn't build up the courage to tell your mom yet. </i></p>

            <p><i>The Highway Story</i> is an interactive story with different endings which I wrote with inklewriter.
                Will you be able to patch things up with your mom? Good luck!</p>
