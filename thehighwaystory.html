            <p><i>It's a hot Sunday morning, the sun has risen just about an hour ago.
                    Your mom woke you up early because you have to attend a family lunch at your uncle's. You don't
                    really know much about him, and you don't care much for him either. But he's family and your mom
                    insisted for you to come with her. You know it's going to be a long drive and you're tired from last
                    night's gaming session. It was <b>Just... one... more... turn...</b> all over again. But you needed
                    that to take your mind off of your issues.
                    unfortunately, you're failing your math class and you will have to attend summer classes to be able
                    to get into the next year, and you didn't build up the courage to tell your mom yet.
                    At the same time, your mom has been distant and moody lately. You don't really know what's up with
                    her, but she's been snapping at you a lot. Which is why you had a terrible argument this morning.
                    You're both in a terrible mood.
                    Sitting at the back of the car, you've been on the road for a few minutes only but you can already
                    feel the tension.</i></p>

            <p><i>The Highway Story</i> is a chill short feel-good story. This is my first solo Ink project, and the
                story is quite simple.<br> My main objectif was to toy with the variables and the CSS.<br>
                Depending on your choices, it can be quite short.<br>
                There is 11 endings.</p>
