            <p>Developed by <a class="text_link" href="https://www.greenheartgames.com/">Greenheart Games</a> (original
                PC version), in partnership with <a class="text_link" href="https://www.rarebyte.com/">Rarebyte</a>
                (Mobile and Switch port). Published by <a class="text_link"

            <p> I worked on the Netflix version, which is the version of the game only available on Netflix ( mobile
                devices).</p>
            <p>My main role on the project was Narrative Designer/Game Writer, but I am also responsible for part of the
                new UIs. </p>
            <p>Bullet point list of my work:
                <br>• Narrative: Establishing the list of licences to use and writing the short funny descriptions for
                most
                of them.
                <br>• Narrative: Helped in the design of several of the licenced-games related quests and writing the
                texts and reviews.
                <br>• Narrative: Establishing the list of Streamers/Youtubeurs to include, changing their name to a
                parody version and establishing their prefered (in-game) game type and audience.
                <br>• UI: Designed the catalogue page for licences.
                <br>• UI: Partly designed the "Chose a streamer" marketing page.
                <br>• UI: Designed the "Watch stream" screen.
                <br>• Bug Fixing: Helped with bug fixing in the UI (original and new content).</p>
