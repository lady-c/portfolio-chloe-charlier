            <p> AVT (Audi Visual Training) was a very interesting challenge because it isn't really a game. It can be
                defined as a "gamified training program" aimed at an audience that likely doesn't consist of gamers.</p>
            <p>I worked on this project as a UI Designer and UX consultant. My role involved simplifying some UIs and
                improving their visibility and clarity.</p>
            <p>An additional difficulty was that the entire documentation was in German, as the app is only available
                in German.</p>
