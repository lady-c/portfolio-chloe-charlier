                <p><i>Only Human</i> is the story of a 10 y/o being the only human in a robot magic school — yep, you
                    read that right! Will you manage to decipher the ancient texts and perform better than your robot
                    classmates?</p>

                <p>The game was developed for the InkJam2021.<br>The jam was
                    hosted from the 27th to the 30th of August 2021, on itch.io.
                    <br>The theme was <b>You'll think of something</b>.
                    <br>Our overall ranking was 20th out of 64.</p>
                <p>I was the Writer and Puzzle Designer. I wrote everything in Ink, and then the story was implemented
                    into Godot by
                    Christina, the team's programmer.</p>
                <p>The game is a Narrative Game with some puzzles. The choices are important and will give you a
                    different narrative experience. Solving of one puzzle in particular will unlock a secret!</p>
