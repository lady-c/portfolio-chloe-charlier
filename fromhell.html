            <p><i>You’re dead.
                    This is all you remember. <br>
                    You wake up in Hell.<br>
                    Is it a mistake? Or do you really deserve to be here? You don't remember doing anyting worthy of
                    Hell. You're absolutely sure that you do not belong here.<br>
                    Only one thing to do, escaping and fighting your way up to the Mount Olympus and join your father,
                    who had you with your mortal mother.<br>
                    The journey will be long and perilous, and not everyone will be here to help you. Hades will not be
                    please to hear about your escape... You should probably not lose too much time.<br>
                    But you’re a half-god. What could go wrong?</i></p>

            <p><i>From Hell</i> is a text-heavy mature branching story (please read the In-Game Content Warning section
                if you're a sensitive reader).<br>This is my second Ink project, much more detailed and complex than <a
                    class="text_link" href="https://lady-c.github.io/portfolio-chloe-charlier/thehighwaystory.html">The
                    Highway Story</a>.
                It uses most of Ink's default functions, with a
                bit of my own code to modify Ink's basic auto-generated JS file.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center;">Game playable in browser and on mobile.<br>Best with sound!</p>
