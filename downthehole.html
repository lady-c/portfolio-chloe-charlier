                    <p>Down the Hole is the story of Dave, who just got out of the movie in a bad mood after seeing a
                        shitty movie. All he wants to do is to go home. But damnit, his keys fall into the sewers! Not
                        wanting to call for help, he just goes down the sewers by himself to look for them. But he gets
                        dragged into a quest he really doesn’t want to accomplish, but he doesn’t really have much
                        choice. Or does he? It’s the player’s choice!</p>

                    <p>This game was developed for the GlobalGameJam 2021, from the Graz Site (Austria). <br>The jam was
                        hosted from the 27th to the 31st of January 2021.</p>
                    <p>I was Narrative and Level Designer on the project. I wrote all the dialogues and implemented them
                        into the game with the custom-made dialogue system developed by one of our developer. I also
                        created all the levels thanks to some free-to-use assets from the Unity store that I modified to
                        personalized them, as well as created some by myself.</p>
                    <p>The game is a 2D platformer.</p>
                    <p>It is playable on <a class="articlelink" href="https://lady-c.itch.io/down-the-hole"
