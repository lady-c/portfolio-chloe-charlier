            <p>Developed by <a class="text_link" href="https://promotion-software.de/website/">Promotion Software</a>,
                in partnership with <a class="text_link" href="https://www.rarebyte.com/">Rarebyte</a>. Published by <a
                    class="text_link" href="https://promotion-software.de/website/">Promotion Software</a>.</p>

            <p>This project was the first time I worked directly with our client/partner without involving someone more
                senior from my company. It was definitely a very formative experience, and I greatly enjoyed
                collaborating with the other UI Designer and Game Designers from Promotion Software.</p>

            <p>Most of the time, to accomplish my tasks, I received very rough concepts from the UI Designer at
                Promotion Software. From there, I would create clean and precise mockups to pass on to our programmer
                for implementation. Occasionally, I was provided with only some ideas and directions and had to create
                concepts from scratch. After a few months on the project, I had a comprehensive understanding of it and
                its design, and I became the primary person our programmers consulted for assistance.</p>

            <p>Bullet points list of UIs I have worked on:
                <br>• Design of building/purchase menus
                <br>• Design of in-game monetization shop elements
                <br>• Main quests pop-ups
                <br>• In-game special events pop-ups
                <br>• Player temporary and permanent ban pop-up
                <br>• Player profile
                <br>• Quests progression screens
                <br>• Entire design of the graphics (icons) and UIs for the weather system (late game update using the
                real-life weather of the player's location)
            </p>
